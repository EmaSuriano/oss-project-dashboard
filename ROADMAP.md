# Roadmap

- [x] Provide basic setup with Github and Argon
- [x] Customize project via file configuration
- [x] Deploy to Netlify
- [x] Write basic setup documentation
- [ ] Remove all the boilerplate from the project and install argon as a dependency and import the files from there.
- [ ] Implement Github Login inside the app
- [ ] Save project list inside Github gist so when the user is logged in we read from there, with this people don't have to clone and set up their own repo!

## Bugs

- When deployed on Netlify the route redirects to `/admin/index` which works but when you reload then it doesn't find the route.
